    <b style="color: green;"> 1. LALBAGH</b><br>
    <br>
    <p>Lalbagh Botanical Garden or simply Lalbagh (lit. 'red garden'), is an botanical garden in Bangalore, India, with an over 200-year history. First planned and laid out during the dalavaiship of Hyder Ali and later managed under numerous British Superintendents before Indian Independence. 
        It was responsible for the introduction and propagation of numerous ornamental plants as well as those of economic value. 
        It also served a social function as a park and recreational space, with a central glass house dating from 1890 which was used for flower shows. 
        In modern times it hosts two flower shows coinciding with the week of Republic Day (26 January) and Independence Day (15 August). 
        As an urban green space along with Cubbon Park, it is also home to numerous wild species of birds and other wildlife. 
        The garden also has a lake adjoining a large rock on which a watchtower had been constructed during the reign of Kempegowda II.</p>

    <p>The High Court of Karnataka (IAST: Karnātaka Ucca N'yāyālaya, commonly called the Karnataka High Court) is the High Court of the Indian state of Karnataka and thus its highest judicial authority.

                <br>
                <p>This public park was first named as Meade's Park after Sir John Meade, the acting commissioner of Mysuru in 1870 and subsequently renamed as Cubbon Park after the longest-serving commissioner of the time, Sir Mark Cubbon.

Chamarajendra Park, in memory of the 19th-century ruler of the state Sri Chamarajendra Wodeyar (1868–94), during whose rule the park came into existence.</p><br>
